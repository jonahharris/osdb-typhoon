This is Thomas B. Pedersen's original Changelog up to version 1.10.3. The
CHANGES file summarized changes done by Kaz Kylheku. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10.3

    o A calloc() call in ddlp.c had only one argument.

Version 1.10.2

    o d_getsequence() would generate a SIGSEGV if the database was 
      closed and opened in between calls.

Version 1.10.1

    o Apparently, there was still a problem with variable length records.

Version 1,10

    o After moving global variables to the typhoon structure, foreign keys
      didn't work properly.
    o When the number of open files was 0, e.g. after closing a database,
      an error message 'could not close a file' was printed on the screen.
    o Added support for sequences.
    o d_close() was not protected by ty_lock/ty_unlock calls.
    o btree_close() wrote header which could corrupt the delete chain.
    o vlr_close() wrote header which could corrupt the delete chain.
    o ddlp now expands its tables dynamically.

Version 1.09

    o d_fillnew() wrote mostly zeros when writing variable length records
      that spanned more than one page.

Version 1.08

    o Oops. Forgot to incorporate bug reported by duke@diku.dk. When multiple
      databases were open, ty_closeafile() would only search the first 
      database in dbtab. This bug could cause inconsistent indexes.

Version 1.07

    o Fixed a couple of documentation errors.
    o btree_add() was missing a call to btree_getheader() which could cause
      indexes to get corrupted. This only happened when multiple processes
      were doing heavy insert/delete operations on the same index.
    o Many have requested that man pages be moved to section 3. This has now
      been done.

Version 1.06

    o Added ASCII manual.
    o In a variable length record table with foreign keys, the last few bytes
      of each record would be lost.

Version 1.05

    o Added OS/2 makefiles.

Version 1.04

    o Minor modifications to configure script.
    o typhoon.h no longer requires inclusion of sys/types.h.
    o Corrected syntax error in RISC alignment code.

Version 1.03

    o Added configure script.
    o Torsten Liermann reported a memory access error found with purify. The
      error only occurred when closing a database, so it rarely occurred.
    o The demonstration program in ./examples forgot to set the length
      determinator of product.description.
    o Support for platforms with sizeof(long)=8, e.g. Alpha.
    o Tricky construct in sym_addmember() made calloc() return NULL on
      some platforms.

Version 1.02

    o New makefiles by George Sipe should fix a lot of conflicts on platforms
      I haven't been able to compile the code on.

Version 1.01

    o Just after releasing version 1.0 I was informed about two missing 
      include files. Stupid mistake which has now been fixed.
